# Cosine-Similarity-and-TF-IDF

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. Similarity measures have a multiude of uses in machine learning projects; they come in handy when matching strings, measuring distance, and extracting features. This similarity measurement is particularly concerned with orientation, rather than magnitude. We will use the cosine similarity to compare both a numeric data within a plane and a text dataset for string matching.
